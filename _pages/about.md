I am an Undergraduate Student Researcher in the **Robotics and Computer Vision Lab** at **University of Seoul (UOS)**. 
I am pursuing a double major in **Geoinformatics** and **Artificial Intelligence**.

My research interests lie in the intersection of robotics, computer vision, and AI applications. 
I am passionate about building intelligent systems that can understand and interact with the physical world.

If you are interested in my research projects or potential collaborations, please feel free to contact me.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.


Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
